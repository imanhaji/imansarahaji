<br>The PNSN is an organization dedicated to reducing impacts of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in the states of Washington and Oregon by providing accurate and fast information about earthquakes and ground motions to scientists, engineers, planners, and the public. Beginning in 1969 with five seismometers, the PNSN has grown to more than 300 seismograph stations distributed across the region and become the second largest seismic network in the United States.</p>

<br>Our technology is a modular crosswalk composed of a 3D printed substrate holding LEDs that light up as pedestrians move across it. When weight is applied to the modules, LEDs light up directly under the pedestrian creating a radius of illumination. This illumination allows traffic, specifically at uncontrolled and mid-block crossings, to see the pedestrian’s exact location at quite a distance. The solar component allows the crosswalk to be off-grid and applicable in low-infrastructure areas, increasing pedestrian safety when other traffic systems cannot. To enhance sustainability, our crosswalk modules are made from a waste byproduct, reducing the material ending up in landfills. Our crosswalk modules are efficient to assemble, making it feasible to implement this solution on a large scale.</p>

<br>Summer Challenge is an academically advanced summer program for children who will have completed the 5th or 6th grade. Summer Challenge provides motivated students with an intensive, hands-on, fun, and educational experience in areas outside of the traditional school curriculum.</p>
